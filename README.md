<h1 align="center">FAVOURITE PROJECTS:</h1>

<h3 align="center">
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/orangutan">Orangutan</a>
</h3>

- A lightweight, minimalistic Rust web server framework inspired by the simplicity and elegance of Python’s Flask.
- Orangutan was created as a deep-dive into asynchronous architectures, network programming, and the internals of HTTP handling—while trying keeping the developer experience as straightforward as possible.
- Despite its simplicity, Orangutan is a fully open-source project published on crates.io, where it has already surpassed 5,000 downloads.

</h3>

- A custom DIY smartwatch PCB built to explore electronics, low-level programming, and embedded systems.
- Features an ESP32, touchscreen support, GSM/GPRS connectivity, and a full battery management system.
- Designed for learning and experimentation — schematics and layouts are available on OSHWlab and my Github.
